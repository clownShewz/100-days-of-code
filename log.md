### Day 1: February 04, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: Worked through FreeCodeCamp Full Stack Web Developer curriculum and started the first challenge, creating a tribute page. Also started working on photo album for Molly's site. Learned about Google fonts api.

**Thoughts: Not a bad start and a good refresher but looking forward to getting into new things.
