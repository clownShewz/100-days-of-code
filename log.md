### Day 3: February 06, 2017 
**Today's Progress:Finished the portfolio page. Learned about Font Awesome when trying to get my social network links in. 

**Thoughts: Spent a lot of time messing around with design and colors. Need to work on my design abilities and layout skills. A lot of stumbling blocks there. It was fun to mess around more with design as I spend more time it seems on functionality.

### Day 4: February 07, 2017 
**Today's Progress:Started working on the picture album for the website. Working through sematic's grid and image displays. Started working through code camps javascript tasks. Again trying to use the stuff I know as review and practice instead of skipping ahead. 

**Thoughts: Solid progress. Images appearing in a basic way. Want to separate the image logic out.

### Day 5: February 08, 2017 
**Today's Progress: Worked through an issue with my D3 and Angular 2 implementation of a hangman game. I was trying to attach the D3 canvas to a div that didn't exist yet. Took a minute to figure out that was happening. Also worked through new compenant for my daughter's website. I wanted to create a picture component that would be responsible for managing each image in her picture album. Another change to work through passing data down through the components. 

**Thoughts:Productive day got through a stumbling block. Started reading up on Dependency Injection in Angular2.  

**Link to work: will post when I finish creating generic modules for the website stuff.

### Day 6: February 09, 2017 
**Today's Progress: Started tackling the image component in my daughter's website. Got the design amnd layout in place and started framing out the input for adding descriptions. 

**Thoughts:Got hung up by starting to code without a real plan of action but as I continued to work I reached some clarity. I think I ended up with a solid solution and really like the final product.  

### Day 6: February 10, 2017 
**Today's Progress: Continued pushing through the Javascript tasks on Free Code Camp. Finished creating the inputs and working though some Angular 2 form concepts. After a few attempts and some issues I feel like the idea is starting to gel in my brain. Hope to add the storage component so the descriptions are being persisted.

**Thoughts:Frustrating mistakes. Head not in the game today. 

#####WAS SICK FOR A WEEK AND HAD ALREADY FALLEN BEHIND ON MY LOG. WILL UPDATE THESE DAYS LATER FROM MY NOTES. 

### Day 20: February 27, 2017 
**Today's Progress:Finished up the Quote Generator and started on the weather page challenge in Free Code Camp.
Wrote the code sepeately on webstorm need to clean things up so I can add to code pen. 
**Thoughts: Styling is getting easier but it seems like most of the time spent on the page is related to design. 

### Day 21: February 28, 2017 
**Today's Progress:Continued work on the weather app. Decided to use the Dark Sky api becuase it's pretty nice. Not sure how I'm going to work this into a code pen. I liked the extra challenge of having to create a server in the middle to call and return the data from Dark Sky. Completed a very simplistic version of that tonight. Currently piping the reposnse into a file. I'll be passing that back and adding a check to only call the API if that file is older than 10 minutes. 
**Thoughts: Like working with Node and Express. request module makes working with API's less complicated.
